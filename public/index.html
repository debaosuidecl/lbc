                            motor insurance, or auto insurance)  is insurance for cars, trucks, motorcycles,
                             and other road vehicles. Its primary use is to
                              provide financial protection against physical damage
                               or bodily injury resulting from traffic 
                               collisions and against liability that could 
                               also arise from incidents in a vehicle. Vehicle 
                               insurance may additionally offer financial protection
                                against theft of the vehicle, and against damage
                                 to the vehicle sustained from events other than 
                                 traffic collisions, such as keying, weather 
                                 or natural disasters, and damage sustained 
                                 by colliding with stationary objects. 
                                 The specific terms of vehicle insurance
                                  vary with legal regulations in each region.
